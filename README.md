# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code challenges. It's inspired by Robin's repository.

## Usage

### Generate a new file for today's challenge:

```bash
pnpm gen
```

### Generate a file for a specific day and year:

```bash
pnpm gen 1 2022
```

### Clean the repository:

If you're forking or cloning this repo, it's recommended to remove existing submissions:

```bash
pnpm clean
```

Then generate new files as needed.

## Input Data

To fetch input data, you need to provide your session cookie in the `.env` file.

## Templates

Templates for different days are located in the `templates` folder. You can customize these by creating, modifying, or deleting templates as needed.

## Note

This README and the project structure are designed to make it easy to manage and organize your Advent of Code solutions. Feel free to modify the structure to suit your preferences.
