My Advent of Code solutions so far.

This repo is inspired from Robin's repo.

Usage

Run the `pnpm gen` (or yarn or npm or whatever) command to generate a new file for today's challenge.

Or specific day and year:

```bash
pnpm gen 1 2022
```

If you are forking/cloning this repo, I suggest to use the `pnpm clean` command to remove my submissions from the `src` folder and then run the `pnpm gen` command.

Note: To get the inputs in the data folder, you'll need to provide your session cookie in the `.env` file.

## Templates

The templates are in the `templates` folder. You can find the templates for the different days in the `templates` folder.
You can create/delete the templates you want to use.
